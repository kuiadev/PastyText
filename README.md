### Docker Compose

These instructions assume the usage of Caddy, but you could use whatever reverse proxy server that suits your needs.

1. Copy contents below to a new file named `compose.yaml` and save it into a new folder

    ```yaml
    services:
        pastytext:
            image: kuia/pastytext:${PT_VERSION}
            ports:
            - "8080"
            volumes:
            - db_data:/dbdata
        caddy:
            image: caddy:2.10.0
            restart: unless-stopped
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
            - "2019:2019"
            volumes:
            - ./:/etc/caddy
            - ./site:/srv
            - caddy_data:/data
            - caddy_config:/config

    volumes:
        caddy_data:
        caddy_config:
        db_data:
    ```
    
2. In this folder, also create a file named `Caddyfile` with the following content
    
    ```yaml
    127.0.0.1:80 {
        reverse_proxy pastytext:8080
    }
    ```
    
    * If you’re hosting PasatyText on the web and want to take advantage of HTTPS, your Caddyfile can instead look like the following (replace “example.com” with your domain or subdomain). [Be sure](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/https) to update your domain’s A/AAAA records in your DNS provider to point to your server.
        
        ```yaml
        example.com {
            reverse_proxy pastytext:8080
        }
        ```
        
3. Run the following command, replace `XXX` with the desired release version (e.g. 1.0.0). `-d` utilizes detached mode to run in the background (you’ll probably want to use this mode on your server).
    
    ```bash
    PT_VERSION=XXX docker compose up -d
    ```
    

### Run from source code

1. Navigate to the folder in which you downloaded the PastyText source code.
2. Run the following command.
    
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

💡

You may need to update the `dial()` function in the index.js file by replacing `wss://` with `ws://` in order for web sockets to run locally.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) <a name="faqs"></a>

### 🧐 How does PastyText work?

PastyText allows users on the same network to share text snippets on a self-hosted page. Users can paste text, which is then visible to anyone on that same network.

### 🧐 Is PastyText secure?

PastyText is not designed for secure sharing of sensitive information like passwords. It operates in plain text, so ensure your network is secure if you choose to share sensitive data.

### 🧐 Can I use PastyText on any device?

Yes! PastyText is a web-based tool that works in any browser, making it accessible on any device that has access to the web/network.

### 🧐 How long does the shared text persist?

The text persists as long as the SQLite storage remains. If you’re using Docker Compose, updating the service may result in purging of the data. Users can delete individual snippets at any time.

### 🧐 Can I share more than just text?

Currently, PastyText only supports text sharing. However, future updates may include support for additional formats.
